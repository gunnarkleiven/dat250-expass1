### DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 1

* Technical problems
  - I did not encounter any spesific technical problem when installing the software development environment. 
* Validation
  - By working through the turorial for deploying Java applications on the Heroku platform, I validated that the environment is working
* Technical problems regarding the Heroku platform
  - I did not encounter any technical problems with the Heroku platform either. I did however skip the "Provision add-ons" page of the tutorial, so I wouldn't have to validate my account by a credit card (which I heard some other students had to use). I will validate the account later if it has to be done.
* Pending issues
  - There were no pending issues that I did not manage to solve.
